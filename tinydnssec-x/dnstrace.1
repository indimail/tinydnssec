.SH NAME
dnstrace \- dns lookup tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dnstrace 
.I t
.I fqdn
.I r

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdnstrace\fR searches for all DNS servers that can affect the resolution
of records of type \fIt\fR under the domain name \fIfqdn\fR, starting from
the root server \fIr\fR. You can list more than one root server.

\fBdnstrace\fR uses the standard DNS resolution algorithm, but follows all
possible paths in the algorithm.  It prints all responses it receives from
DNS servers; it also prints warnings about slow servers, dead servers,
misdelegated (``lame'') servers, and misformatted packets. \fBdnstrace\fR
is similar in spirit to DOC and dnswalk but is much more effective than
those tools at debugging resolution problems.

In versions 1.03 and above: You can pipe \fBdnstrace\fR through
\fBdnstracesort\fR(1) for human-friendly output. \fBdnstrace\fR can take a
long time to run, so standard procedure is to save its output in a file:

.EX
  dnstrace any www.aol.com a.root-servers.net > AOL &
.EX

Then you can run \fBdnstracesort\fR(1) to see the results so far:

.EX
  dnstracesort < AOL | less
.EX

The \fBdnstracesort\fR(1) output uses \fIul\fR codes for boldface and
underline; these codes are displayed properly by \fBless\fR(1).

Beware that, as of January 2001, \fBdnstrace\fR produces more than 5
megabytes of output for the complete trace of cr.yp.to starting from all
the root servers. It ends up sending more than 6000 queries to more than
200 different servers.

\fBdnstrace\fR exits 111 for temporary errors including when unable to
write to descriptor 1.
