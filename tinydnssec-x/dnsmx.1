.SH NAME
dnsmx \- prints the MX records of fqdn

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dnsmx
.I fqdn

.SH DESCRIPTION

\fBdnsmx\fR prints the MX records of \fIfqdn\fR.  If there are no MX
records, \fBdnsmx\fR prints an artificial MX record, simulating the
behavior of MTAs.

Normally \fBdnsmx\fR exits 0. If \fBdnsmx\fR encounters a temporary problem
that prevents it from determining the list of MX records, it prints an
error message and exits 111. It also exits 111 if it is not able to write
the ip address to descriptor 1.
