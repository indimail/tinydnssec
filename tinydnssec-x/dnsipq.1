.SH NAME
dnsipq \- dns lookup tool

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dnsipq 
[
.I udn
]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdnsipq\fR feeds the name  \fIudn\fR through \fBqualification\fR(5). It
prints the fully qualified domain name and IP addresses on a single line.
If the fully qualified domain name does not exist, \fBdnsipq\R prints no
addresses. You can list several \fIudn\fR s; \fBdnsipq\fR prints each
result on a separate line.

Normally \fBdnsipq\fR exits 0. If \fdnsipq\fR encounters a temporary
problem that prevents it from determining the list of IP addresses, it
prints an error message and exits 111. It also exits 111 if it is not able
to write the ip address to descriptor 1.
