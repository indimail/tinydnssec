.SH NAME
dnsname/dnsnamex \- does a reverse lookup for the IP address

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B dnsname
.I a.b.c.d

.B dnsnamex
.I a.b.c.d

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBdnsname\fR does a reverse lookup for the IP address \fIa.b.c.d\fR. It
prints the first domain name for that address. If no domain names are
listed in DNS, \fBdnsname\fR prints a blank line. You can list several IP
addresses; \fBdnsname\fR prints each result on a separate line.

\fBdnsnamex\fR, works like dnsname(1) but prints all of the names that an
IP address maps to, instead of just the first one like dnsname does.

There is also a \fBdnsfilter\fR(1) program that reads IP addresses from its
input and performs many reverse lookups in parallel.

Normally \fBdnsname\fR exits 0. If \fBdnsname\fR encounters a temporary
problem that prevents it from determining the domain name, it prints an
error message and exits 111. It also exits 111 if it is not able to write
the ip address to descriptor 1.
